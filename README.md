# MBR Fouling Simulation (Runge-Kutta Method)

This project simulates membrane fouling dynamics in Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) systems using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method, based on two real-world case studies.

## 📘 Reference Papers

- Wu et al., 2012 – Constant aeration strategy  
- De Temmerman et al., 2015 – Fine bubble dynamic aeration

## 🧮 Model Variables

- **TMP**: Transmembrane pressure (kPa)  
- **Colloid**: Colloidal matter concentration (mg/L)  
- **SMP**: Soluble microbial product concentration (mg/L)

## 📊 Simulation Highlights

- Python with `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` (RK4)  
- 48-hour dynamic simulation under two aeration regimes  
- Visualization of TMP, colloid, and SMP dynamics

## 🔍 Conclusion

Dynamic aeration with fine bubbles significantly reduced fouling rate and SMP accumulation, aligning with experimental findings from literature.
